=======================

## Requirements

Create an app that shows information about countries. The first view of the app should show the list of countries loaded
from the `https://restcountries.com` service in the JSON format. The tap on the country should open a new view with details about the selected country. It is up to you what details to show, but at least show four different fields. It would be nice if some of those fields a graphical in nature (a flag, or a map of the country boundaries).

* The app should target a common phone form factor. You may limit your app to work only in that mode in the project's configurations.

* The app should target the portrait screen mode. You may limit your app to work only in that mode in the project's configurations.

* The app should be of acceptable visual quality.

* A certain level of creative freedom is acceptable here as long as you have all the components and logic outlined here and during the classes.

## Submission

Put the root project directory under the folder `lab-3` in your private course repository on GitHub. If you don't have a private repository on GitHub for this course, ask the instructor for instructions on how to create one. Ensure that you have proper `.gitignore` files in your project folders to ignore intermediate and compiled files. We do not need them in your repository. Finally, commit and push the work to GitHub. The last commit ID to a snapshot representing your final work must be submitted to Canvas before the deadline.

You have to create only one app for one platform of your choice. If you have decided to develop apps for both platforms, put the projects under subfolders `android` and `ios` in your `lab-3` directory.
